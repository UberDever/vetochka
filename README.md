# Vetochka

`Vetochka` is a interpreted functional language, based on `tree-calculus`. 

Language characterized by:

- Simplest language core I can pull off, with different levels of syntax sugar to facilitate
complex semantics
- Somewhat esoteric base calculus (the variant of `tree-calculus`)
- Big sandbox for various design ideas, thanks to core calculus and inherent dynamic nature

The main application in mind also is rather esoteric -- rich preprocessor/metalanguage for `C` with
the understanding of the underlying language.
