# Tree-lang grammar

## Tokenization

The following token groups are there:
- Tree: designates the tree-calculus combinator, denoted as `Î”` or `^`
- Delimeter: any token from the list `()[],`
- String: anything enclosed in outermost curly braces `{}`
- Symbol: any other token

Note that this simple tokenization requires further parsing and encoding.

## Language

The following is the EBNF of the language:

```
Source ::=
